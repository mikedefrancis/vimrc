Warpcore is a heavily modified .vimrc file. It remaps many things, and allows you to use Ctrl-s, Ctrl-q, etc. to save,
quit, copy, paste, undo, redo, etc. like the other editors. It does this without removing too much of the stock vim
functionality. In fact, I find this .vimrc much more functional than stock vim. It is easier to make bookmarks, create
macros, find and replace text, etc. Only a minimal number of plugins are used, and none of them are required.

* See the comments at hte top of the .warcore_vimrc to understand all of my hotkey remaps
* Some older versions of this .vimrc are provided (heavy_vimrc and light_vimrc) for reference.
* install simply by running the script corresponding to the version of the vimrc that you want
* These have only been tested on ubuntu 16.04 but should work on 18.04 as well and other versions of linux 
* see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF9EcpYb1KE for details using vundle and vim

## RECOMMENDED: i3 Window Manager

* see my stuff at https://www.github.com/mikedefrancis/ubuntu-i3

## REFERENCE

* Vim Cheatsheet For Programmers (note that I broke some of these hotkeys and may consider restoring their functionality later)
